\chapter{Exercise 18: Pointers To Functions}

Functions in C are actually just pointers to a spot in the
program where some code exists.  Just like you've been creating
pointers to structs, strings, and arrays, you can point a
pointer at a function too.  The main use for this is to pass
"callbacks" to other functions, or to simulate classes and
objects.  In this exercise we'll do some callbacks, and in
the next one we'll make a simple object system.
