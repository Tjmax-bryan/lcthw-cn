\chapter{Exercise 20: Advanced Data Types }

You've been exposed to different ways to structure data and how C perceives 
that data in your computer's memory, so now we'll cover all the remaining
specific information about types and the data they can hold.  This exercise
is more of a reference that explains different things C does, with code examples
for each.  You'll then be tasked with making flash cards and memorizing them
so you know them cold.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the tables of information presented in this chapter, and write up
    flash cards for each row.  Use these flash cards to spend 15 minutes a
    day (or more) memorizing everything you can.
