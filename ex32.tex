\chapter{Exercise 32: The BBS Project}

The rest of this book will apply our knowledge about C to create a simple
Bulleting Board Service (BBS).  If you haven't used a BBS before, they were
systems that let people dial one computer from their own computer and leave
messages for other folks.  Long before the internet became popular or any
social network existed, BBSes let people hang out and communicate with people
all over the world.

Our BBS will be simple, and will be connected to the internet rather than
through a phone line.  Our BBS will also be written using modern C code and
with modern libraries like SQLite3.  Hopefully by completing the rest of this
book you'll learn both good C skills and how to write a network server.

But, don't worry, despite what people try to say writing little servers in C is
pretty easy.  It's writing big servers in C that sucks.
