\chapter{Introduction: The Cartesian Dream Of C}

\begin{quotation}

Whatever I have up till now accepted as most true and assured I have gotten
either from the senses or through the senses. But from time to time I have
found that the senses deceive, and it is prudent never to trust completely
those who have deceived us even once.

    \attrib{Rene Descartes, Meditations On First Philosophy}
\end{quotation}

If there ever were a quote that described programming with C, it would be this.
To many programmers, this makes C scary and evil.  It is the Devil, Satan, the
trickster Loki come to destroy your productivity with his seductive talk of
pointers and direct access to the machine.  Then, once this computational
Lucifer has you hooked, he destroys your world with the evil "segfault" and
laughs as he reveals the trickery in your bargain with him.

But, C is not to blame for this state of affairs.  No my friends, your computer
and the Operating System controlling it are the real tricksters.  They conspire
to hide their true inner workings from you so that you can never really know
what is going on.  The C programming language's only failing is giving you
access to what is really there, and telling you the cold hard raw truth.  C
gives you the red pill.  C pulls the curtain back to show you the wizard.
\emph{C is truth.}

Why use C then if it's so dangerous?   Because C gives you power over the false
reality of abstraction and liberates you from stupidity.
