\chapter{Exercise 21: Scope And The Stack}

The concept of "scope" seems to confuse quite a few people when they first
start programming.  Originally it came from the use of the system stack
(which we lightly covered earlier) and how it was used to store temporary
variables.  In this exercise, we'll learn about scope by learning about
how a stack data structure works, and then feeding that concept back in
to how modern C does scoping.

We'll also learn the kinds of things to avoid when dealing with the
scoping rules that C has.
