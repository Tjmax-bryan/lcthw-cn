\chapter{Exercise 2: Make Is Your Python Now}

In \href{http://learnpythonthehardway.org}{Python} you ran programs by just
typing \verb|python| and the code you wanted to run.  The Python interpreter
would just run them, and import any other libraries and things you needed
on the fly as it ran.  C is a different beast completely where you have to
\emph{compile} your source files and manually stitch them together into
a binary that can run on its own.  Doing this manually is a pain, and in
the last exercise you just ran \file{make} to do it.

In this exercise, you're going to get a crash course in GNU make, and you'll
be learning to use it as you learn C.  Make will for the rest of this book,
be your Python.  It will build your code, and run your tests, and set things
up and do all the stuff for you that Python normally does.

The difference is, I'm going to show you smarter Makefile wizardry, where you
don't have to specify every stupid little thing about your C program to get
it to build.  I won't do that in this exercise, but after you've been using
"baby make" for a while, I'll show you "master make".

... explain basic usage of make to just build single files ...

... go into a simple makefile ...

... show how to run the simple makefile ...
