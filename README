This will be a book teaching C programming to anyone who has already learned
one other programming language.  It will teach modern C with heavy emphasis
on reliable programming.

If one wants to build this book locally, the `dexy` tool (>=0.4.0) and a suite
of LaTeX tools that includes the "iwona" library must be installed.  Assuming
one is running a recent Debian-based Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, the
LaTeX dependencies may be satisfied with the `texlive-full` package:

    aptitude install texlive-full

The latest version of the `dexy` tool may be installed from github:

    git clone https://github.com/ananelson/dexy.git
    cd dexy && python setup.py install
