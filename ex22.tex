\chapter{Exercise 22: Advanced Flow Control}

You know how the stack works, and how scoping works in your C programs.  With
that concept in place, you can now learn about all the kinds of "flow control"
C supports.  "Flow control" just means controlling how the execution of the
program "flows" with \ident{if-statements}, \ident{for-loops}, etc.  In this
exercise you'll get information and you'll be expected to spend time memorizing
it so it's solid in your mind.
