\chapter{Exercise 22: Advanced Data Types And Flow Control}

This exercise will be a complete compendium of the available C data types and
flow control structures you can use.  It will work as a reference to complete
your knowledge, and won't have any code for you to enter.  I'll have you
memorize some of the information by creating flash cards so you can get 
the important concepts solid in your mind.
