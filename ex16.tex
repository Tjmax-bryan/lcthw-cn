\chapter{Exercise 16: Structs And Pointers To Them}

While it's useful to have all the various data types C has,
it's more useful to package them into a cohesive container.
A \ident{struct} is how C creates cohesive records, and the
closest construct you might know is classes and objects.  However,
\ident{structs} predate Object Oriented Programming so they're
not quite the same.

In this exercise you'll learn how to make a \ident{struct},
create an array of them, point a pointer at them, and use them
to make sense of internal memory structures.
