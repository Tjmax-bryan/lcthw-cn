\chapter{Exercise 23: Meet Duff's Device}

This exercise is a brain teaser where I introduce you to one of the
most famous hacks in C called "Duff's Device", named after Tom Duff
the "inventor".  This little slice of awesome (evil?) has nearly everything
you've been learning wrapped in one tiny little package.  Figuring out
how it works is also a good fun puzzle.

\begin{aside}{If You Use This You Shall Be Ridiculed}
Part of the fun of C is that you can come up with crazy hacks like this,
but this is also what makes C annoying to use.  It's good to learn about
these tricks because it gives you a deeper understanding of
the language and your computer.  But, you should never use this.  Always
strive for easy to read straight forward code.
