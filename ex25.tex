\chapter{Exercise 25: Variable Argument Functions}

In C you can create your own versions of functions like \func{printf} and
\func{scanf} by creating a "variable argument function".  These functions use
the header \file{stdarg.h} and with them you can create nicer interfaces to
your library.  They are handy for certain types of "builder" functions,
formatting functions, and anything that takes variable arguments.
