\chapter{Exercise 27: Defensive Programming}

Welcome to part 2 of the book, where we take your freshly minted basic skills and
apply them to a real project.  We first need to cover some concepts you'll need
to use while you work on the project.  First up is the idea of "defensive programming"
and how to write rock solid C code (or at least as close as you can get to it).

In this exercise we'll expand on the macros you learned in Exercise 26 and 
use them religiously during the rest of the book.  You'll also learn a set of
rules you need to follow while you code and review your code.
