\chapter{Preface}

You can grab the \href{http://learncodethehardway.org/LearnCTheHardWay-preview.pdf}{PDF Preview}
to take a look.  Otherwise this is a rough dump of the book as I build the structure.

There is a mailing list for the book at
\href{mailto:lcthw@librelist.com}{lcthw@librelist.com} which you can join.
I'll be doing announcements as new material is up, and you can ask questions if
you get stuck or have comments.

Finally, don't forget that I have \href{http://learnpythonthehardway.org}{Learn Python The Hard Way, 2nd Edition} which you should read if you can't code yet.   LCTHW will
\emph{not} be for beginners, but for people who have at least read LPTHW or know
one other programming language.
