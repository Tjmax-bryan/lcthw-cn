\chapter{Exercise 19: A Simple Object System}

I learned C before I learned Object Oriented Programming, so 
it helped me to build an OOP system in C to understand the
basics of what OOP meant.  You are probably the kind of person
who learned an OOP language before you learned C, so this kind
of bridge might help you as well.  In this exercise, we will
build a simple object system.
