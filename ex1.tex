\chapter{Exercise 1: Dust Off That Compiler}

Here is a simple first program you can make in C:

\begin{code}{ex1.c}
<< d['code/ex1.c|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

You can put this into a \file{ex1.c} then type:

\begin{code}{Building ex1}
\begin{Verbatim}
make ex1
./ex1
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}

Try it and let me know if it worked.  If you type this \verb|make ex1.c| then
you're doing it wrong and need to pay attention to what I typed.  C does not
treat kindly those who lack attention to detail.
