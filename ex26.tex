\chapter{Exercise 26: The C Pre-Processor}

The final exercise in part 1 is an introduction to the "cpp" or C Pre-Processor.
It's usually spelled "c preprocessor" now, but without the hyphen you wouldn't
understand why it's call "cpp".  You'll learn what cpp does, and why it's 
typically used wrong.  We'll then cover some handy macros you'll end up
needing in part 2.
